Rapper, beat mistress, New Yorker.

Wonda, or Rebecca Williams, is a multi-instrument producer and prolific
rapper from the underground movement. Born and raised in Harlem, New York,
Wonda's work is textured by the distinct rhythms and idiosyncracies of the
city, with a light nerdcore touch.

A passionate fan of superhero comics and old jazz, Wonda has dilligently
worked both into her incredible body of work. With over two decades in the
industry, her touch has been felt across the rap world, and her production
can be found on the work of prolific artists including Billy Lean, OG Carmenn,
Reggie Odin, and Ricky Slither.

Still living in her home city, much of Wonda's work is dedicated to innovating
the rap and jazz scenes, and mentoring the stable of artists under her co-owned
record label, ACID HAUS. She's still looking for an issue of _Amazing Fantasy #15_
