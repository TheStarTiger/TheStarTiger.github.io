Hungrier, older and sharper than before, Wonda followed her first era of production focus with one of the most legendary
underground records. Refined over the course of 6 years with long-time collaborater Subwavv, _Subwonda_ is a gorgeous
palette of both artists' work and a monument to their incredible friendship. This record earned a Grammy nomination following
the massive success of  the track _Queen of Concrete_, and still stands as one of the highest reviewed albums of all time.
