**ep**

New York is a brutal, beautiful city, and after 40 years of living there, Wonda would know
better than most. Recorded following a near-suicidal depressive episode, _Ghosts of New York City_
documents the tales of Malethe family, residents of the city since the early 40s, and close friends
with Wonda. Cold, sonically sparse, and evocatively brief, _Ghosts_ contains some of Wonda's most
biting, sharp flows.

**tracklist:**
1. Pharoah
2. Since Darryl
3. Brother, Brother
4. ghost(Interlude)
5. Hello Morning
