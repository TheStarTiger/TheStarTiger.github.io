# Design Decisions 

My primary drive was to create a layout that simultaneously conveyed the vibrancy of Wonda's early career, but also transmitted the pared back, refined precision of her later productions. The movement of her covers away from her initially deeply comic roots, into something a little more grounded, mirrored this aspiration. I was inspired by the styles of similar real-life rappers, like Earl Sweatshirt and MF Doom, and drew off of elements of their site layouts and aesthetic choices, while adding Wonda's own Scarlet Witch inspired spin.

# Challenge 

As I've mentioned in previous tasks, I struggle to do visual editting in interfaces that don't allow for visuals in their frontend. As such, learning how to be patient in my editing process and willing to check after each change to ensure I got a muscle memory for how each change affected the system. Challenging myself to understand the workings of Jekyll's layout/include dynamics and the HTML that provided their backbone was an additional challenge, as I'm especially unwelcome to markdown languages. A final challenge was quick production: none of the ten album covers I created existed before this project. One of the things I would have wanted to add was a shopping section (for buying merchandise), but time wasn't quite willing for that addition.
