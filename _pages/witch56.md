titled: Wondaful Presents Witch's Brew Volumes 7, 8 & 9
---


**released:** May 12, 2009

**compilation**


Produced after _Subwonda_, the third _Witch's Brew_ compilation betrayed the experimental direction Wonda would 
later own on _Scarlet Keyys_. Largely considered the best of her beat compilations, Wonda broke tradition in allowing many of the beats present to feature on others' projects in the following years, including
_Ticket to Midnight_ and _Gang Affiliated_.
