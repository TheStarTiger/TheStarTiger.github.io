The followup to her debut _Bang!_, _The Miraculous Wonda Vol. 1 Appear_ solidified her witty, complex rhyme schemes,
sprinkled with nerdcore. A bombastic, eccentric second outting, that manipulated it's lack of studio backing into 
homemade, sample-chopped production by Wonda herself. Includes singles _Customer Service_ and _Bank_.

**tracklist:**
1. Customer Service
2. Alice Ain't Here
3. Stone Throne Avenger (ft. Tony Dark)
4. House Call(Interlude)
5. Bank
6. Empire State of Shine
7. Grimy Time (ft. RRG)
8. Half Past Yours
9. Compromised!
