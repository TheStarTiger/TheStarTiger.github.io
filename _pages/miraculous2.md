titled: The Miraculous Wonda Vol. 2 No Cape Needed

**released:** December 24, 2004

After a stellar showing with _Vol. 1_, fans and critics eagerly awaited _Miraculous Wonda Vol. 2 No Cape Needed_.
But after a huge pickup in demand for her production skills, and her personal mandate for perfection, fans would
have to wait another three years for Wonda's follow-up to arrive. Releasing on Christmas Eve of 2004, the album
felt like the gift of an artist given time to mature her own process. Now signed to ACID HAUS, Wonda's production
was allowed to flourish with her new facilities, in addition to access to several collaboraters (including eventual
long-time friend Subwavv). _No Cape Needed_ retains much of the energy that drove her previous projects, but
textures it with a criticism for a New York that Wonda had more time to process in the shadow of 9/11 and its myriad
political implications.
Her efforts earned her multiple outlet awards and this album has been cited by many prolific artists, including Ricky 
Slither and OG Carmenn, as having inspired their work. Included the legendary _Bone Meal_ and _Shock Tactics_.
