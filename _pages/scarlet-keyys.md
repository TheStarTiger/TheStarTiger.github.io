**ep**


An experimental collaboration cooked in the middle of the second of Wonda's production eras, _Scarlet Keyys_
challenged Wonda and Big Keyys to exclusively rhyme over piano strung beats. Using inspiration and sampling
from across the spectrum of artists, including Ryuichi Sakamoto, Beethoven and Martha Argerich, Subwonda manages
to paint a wild tangle of New York's burgeoning experimental jazz scene with an international palette.  

**tracklist:**
1. Listen
2. Breath
3. Night
4. Buggin
5. Never
6. Sight
7. Death
